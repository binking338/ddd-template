    <!-- localRepository
     | The path to the local repository maven will use to store artifacts.

    <!-- interactiveMode
     | This will determine whether maven prompts you when it needs input. If set to false,
     | maven will use a sensible default value, perhaps based on some other setting, for
     | the parameter in question.

     | Default: true
    <interactiveMode>true</interactiveMode>
    -->

    <!-- offline
     | Determines whether maven should attempt to connect to the network when executing a build.
     | This will have an effect on artifact downloads, artifact deployment, and others.

     | Default: false
    <offline>false</offline>
    -->

    <!-- pluginGroups
     | This is a list of additional group identifiers that will be searched when resolving plugins by their prefix, i.e.
     | when invoking a command line like "mvn prefix:goal". Maven will automatically add the group identifiers
     | "org.apache.maven.plugins" and "org.codehaus.mojo" if these are not already contained in the list.
     |-->
    <pluginGroups>
        <!-- pluginGroup
         | Specifies a further group identifier to use for plugin lookup.
        <pluginGroup>com.your.plugins</pluginGroup>
        -->
    </pluginGroups>

    <!-- proxies
     | This is a list of proxies which can be used on this machine to connect to the network.
     | Unless otherwise specified (by system property or command-line switch), the first proxy
     | specification in this list marked as active will be used.

         | Specification for one proxy, to be used in connecting to the network.

    <!-- servers
     | This is a list of authentication profiles, keyed by the server-id used within the system.
     | Authentication profiles can be used whenever maven must make a connection to a remote server.
     |-->
    <servers>
        <!-- server
         | Specifies the authentication information to use when connecting to a particular server, identified by
         | a unique name within the system (referred to by the 'id' attribute below).
         |
         | NOTE: You should either specify username/password OR privateKey/passphrase, since these pairings are
         |       used together.

    <!-- mirrors
     | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
     |
     | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.
     | However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
     | it to several places.
     |
     | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
     | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
     | server for that repository.
     |-->
    <mirrors>
        <!-- mirror
         | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository. The repository that
         | this mirror serves has an ID that matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used
         | for inheritance and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.
         |
